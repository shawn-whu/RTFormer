# RTFormer:Radiative Transfer Model-Coupled Transformer for Cloud Removal in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery
We have proposed a new cloud removal model\
![network](fig.png)\
Moreover,we have created a new Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) driven cloud simulation synthesis dataset.\
Cloud free image:\

The dataset and model are coming soon
